Awesome—let’s lock the plan and move straight into build mode. Here’s a tight, do-first roadmap that covers **design → build → verify** without getting stuck.

# 1) Decide the product defaults (I’ll assume these unless you say otherwise)

* **Auto-close** personal tab: 2 minutes idle (10-sec warning)
* **Chime**: every 10s until acknowledged
* **TTS** (name call): on, repeat 3 times (“<name>, please enter your PIN.”)
* **Snooze**: off (employees can’t snooze yet)
* **Inventory**: cigarettes only (name, SKU, count, low-stock threshold)
* **Cameras**: simulated in cloud; RTSP when we run on the Lenovo

# 2) Design deliverables (quick, concrete)

* **Kiosk screen (always on)**
  Header, “Current Task”, Alerts feed, Camera panel, “Reopen my tasks” button, plus **overlay card** that pops when someone is called (with TTS + chime + QR to open personal tab).
* **Personal task tab**
  PIN → “My Tasks” (Due Now + Next), buttons: **Done**, **Need help**. Shows idle countdown; auto-closes at 2 min.
* **Admin / Settings**
  Panels: Employees (name, PIN, role), Tasks (list + rotation minutes), Inventory (items + thresholds), Settings (auto-close, TTS, chime interval), “Call Employee” action.
* **Reports (MVP)**
  Daily summary (who was called, what got done/missed), CSV export.

# 3) Build plan (short sprints you can follow today)

**Sprint A — Kiosk + Call flow**

1. Kiosk page (React or plain HTML): show task, alerts, camera (sim).
2. **Audio/TTS**: use Web Speech API for name call + an `<audio>` chime (embedded mp3).
3. **“Call Employee”** admin button → emits event with `{employeeId, employeeName, taskTitle}` → kiosk shows overlay, plays chime + TTS.
4. **Open Task** button + QR link → opens `/me` in a new tab with `employeeId`, then prompts **PIN**.
5. **Acceptance test**: calling “Elisha” pops overlay + speaks her name; clicking opens her tab and asks for PIN.

**Sprint B — Personal tab + Auto-close**

1. Personal tab flow: PIN → fetch “My Tasks” (Due Now + Next).
2. Idle timer: reset on any click/keypress; show 10-sec warning; auto-close at 2 min (redirect to kiosk).
3. “Reopen my tasks” on kiosk → PIN → reopens same view.
4. **Acceptance test**: open tab, do nothing → it closes; from kiosk, reopen via PIN.

**Sprint C — Task engine + Alerts**

1. Scheduler assigns a task every N minutes to **someone on shift** (round-robin for now).
2. Emit `task:new` → kiosk alert; if assigned to a named person, also trigger **Call Employee** behavior.
3. “Done” posts completion; kiosk shows a confirmation alert.
4. **Acceptance test**: tasks rotate; Done creates an alert and a log entry.

**Sprint D — Inventory (light)**

1. Inventory list (name, SKU, count, min threshold).
2. Adjust count (+/-) with reason.
3. Alert when count < threshold.
4. CSV export of inventory log.
5. **Acceptance test**: adjusting below threshold triggers kiosk alert.

**Sprint E — Admin + Reports**

1. Employee CRUD (name, PIN, role), Task CRUD (titles, intervals), Settings (auto-close, TTS, chime).
2. Daily summary (done/missed, average acknowledge time).
3. **Acceptance test**: change settings and see them take effect immediately.

# 4) Minimal data you’ll store (so the UI can work)

* **Employees**: id, name, pin (hashed), role, active
* **Tasks**: id, title, interval\_minutes
* **Assignments**: id, task\_id, assigned\_to (employee id), assigned\_at, due\_at, status (pending/done), completed\_at
* **Events**: ts, type (call, open, done, missed, alert), detail (JSON)
* **Inventory**: id, sku, name, count, min\_threshold
* **Inventory logs**: ts, item\_id, delta, reason, by\_employee

# 5) What you should do **right now**

* Open your **vision-hub** workspace.
* Add these **Pages/Routes**:

  * `/kiosk` (default screen, shows overlay on call)
  * `/me` (personal tab flow: PIN → tasks)
  * `/admin` (call employee, settings, basic CRUD)
* Add these **Events** (Socket-IO or equivalent):

  * `call:employee` → kiosk overlay + TTS/chime
  * `task:new` → kiosk alert (and optionally triggers call)
  * `task:done` → kiosk alert
* Add **Idle timer** on `/me` with auto-close.
* Add **Settings** state (intervals, TTS on/off, auto-close minutes).

# 6) Acceptance checklist for the end of today

* [ ] Kiosk loads with current task + alerts + camera sim
* [ ] Admin can **Call Employee** → kiosk announces by name + overlay shows
* [ ] “Open Task” → personal tab prompts **PIN**
* [ ] Idle 2 min → **auto-close** with warning
* [ ] “Reopen my tasks” works (PIN)
* [ ] Task “Done” → kiosk alert appears
* [ ] Settings (auto-close, TTS, chime) update behavior live

If you want me to package the **Sprint A & B** pieces as a single downloadable folder (kiosk + call + personal tab + auto-close) so you can drop it into your repo or platform, say the word and I’ll ship it as a zip you can use immediately.
