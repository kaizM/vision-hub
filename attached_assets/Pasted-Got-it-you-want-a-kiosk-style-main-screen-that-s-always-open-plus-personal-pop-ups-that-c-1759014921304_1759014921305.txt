Got it — you want a **kiosk-style main screen** that’s always open, plus **personal pop-ups** that call out an employee by name, prompt their PIN, show their tasks, then **auto-close** after \~2 minutes (with a way to reopen their tasks later). Here’s a tight, practical spec we can build against.

# The flow (end-to-end)

1. **Main screen (Kiosk) — always on**

   * Shows: store banner, current rotating task, alert feed, and camera pane.
   * Anyone can see it; no PIN needed.
   * Never times out. This is the screen managers keep up on a counter PC/TV.

2. **Personal “call”**

   * When the system assigns a task (or a manager picks a person), it **fires a personal alert**:

     * **Audio**: a repeating chime + **text-to-speech** (“Elisha, please enter your PIN.”)
     * **Visual**: a bold overlay banner on the kiosk + a **big “Open Task” button**.
   * Clicking “Open Task” (or scanning a QR that appears on the kiosk) opens a **personal task tab** for that employee.

3. **Personal task tab**

   * Step 1: **PIN prompt** (Elisha types her PIN).
   * Step 2: **Assigned tasks** for Elisha only (what’s due now, what’s next).
   * Actions:

     * **Mark Done** (with optional note/photo later)
     * **Snooze** (if allowed by policy) with reason
     * **Need help** (pings shift lead)
   * **Auto-close** after **X minutes of no activity** (default 2). A 10-second warning shows before closing.
   * After closing, the kiosk remains up for everyone.

4. **Reopen later**

   * From the kiosk: “**Reopen my tasks**” button → asks for PIN → reopens Elisha’s tab.
   * Optional: **magic link** (QR code on the kiosk) that opens their tab on a phone; it still requires PIN.

5. **Logging**

   * Every interaction logs to the Event Log: “called”, “opened personal tab”, “marked done”, “auto-closed”, “reopened”.
   * Overdue tasks generate kiosk alerts + optional extra chime.

# Roles & rules

* **Employee**: check in, view/complete own tasks, reopen own tasks.
* **Shift lead**: can reassign/snooze tasks, acknowledge alerts, call a specific employee.
* **Admin**: manage employees, tasks, policies (auto-close time, snooze allowed, volumes).

# Kiosk behaviors (exact)

* **Always-on**; never prompts for PIN.
* **Audio**:

  * **Chime** repeats every 10s while a personal alert is unresolved.
  * **Text-to-speech**: calls name 2–3 times (“Elisha, please enter your PIN”). Volume & repeat count configurable.
* **Overlay card** shows:

  * Employee name (“Elisha”)
  * Task title (“Clean Restroom A”)
  * **Open Task** (button) + **QR** for phone
  * A small “Mute” toggle (shift lead only) to silence chime for 60s.
* **Multiple calls**: If two people are called close together, kiosk queues banners in a stack and cycles every 8s; audio references the next name.

# Personal tab behaviors (exact)

* **Auto-close timer** (default 2 minutes):

  * Resets on any interaction (scroll, click, keypress).
  * 10-second **countdown warning** banner.
  * On close: “Session closed — reopen from kiosk to continue.”
* **Offline-safe**: If network blips, the tab shows a reconnect banner and pauses the timer.
* **Reopen**: From kiosk or by scanning your **QR**, then enter PIN to resume.

# Notifications & sound policy

* **Kiosk sound** chime repeats until:

  * The employee opens their personal tab *or*
  * A shift lead acknowledges the alert (silences for 60s).
* **TTS/voice** plays only during the **first 20s** of a call (avoid constant shouting).
* **Volume** and **repeat limits** are set in Settings.

# Admin settings (what you change in “Settings”)

* **Auto-close minutes** (default 2)
* **Chime repeat interval** (default 10s)
* **Use Text-to-Speech** (on/off), **repeat count** (default 3), **voice** (system default)
* **Allow Snooze** (on/off), **snooze options** (5/10/15 min, configurable)
* **Require “Done” note/photo** (on/off)
* **QR login** (on/off)
* **Kiosk pin** for shift-lead actions (mute/acknowledge)
* **Task rotation minutes** (30/40/etc.)

# Data we’ll store (so reports make sense)

* **Call events**: who was called, what task, when
* **Open events**: when the personal tab opened, by whom, device
* **Actions**: done/snooze/help, notes, timestamps
* **Auto-close**: when idle timeout fired
* **Reopen**: count and times
* **Missed tasks**: if not opened or not completed by due time

# Privacy & safety notes

* The kiosk **never** shows full personal info, only the **first name**.
* PINs are required for personal task tabs.
* TTS avoids sensitive phrases (“banned person”) — that stays in manager alerts only.

# What we’ll build next (change list to your current app)

1. **Kiosk mode** (default homepage)

   * Large layout with task banner, camera pane, alerts list, “Reopen my tasks” button.
   * **Name call overlay** with chime + TTS + QR.
2. **Call employee action**

   * Button for shift lead to **Call \[employee]** with a chosen task (or default next task).
   * Emits kiosk event + audio.
3. **Personal tab**

   * PIN screen → personal task view (due now + next).
   * **Auto-close** with visible countdown.
   * “Reopen” path from kiosk and from QR.
4. **Settings page**

   * All the admin settings above.
5. **Events & reports**

   * Store call/open/done/snooze/close.
   * Daily summary (who was called, done/missed, time-to-acknowledge).

# Config defaults I propose

* **Auto-close**: 2 minutes
* **Chime every**: 10 seconds (max 2 minutes)
* **TTS repeats**: 3 times (“Elisha, please enter your PIN”)
* **Snooze options**: off by default (can enable 5/10/15)
* **Photo required**: off (can enable)
* **QR login**: on
* **Task rotation**: 30 minutes

# Edge cases we’ll handle

* **Employee not present**: If not opened within 2 minutes, kiosk posts **“no response”**; shift lead can reassign.
* **Multiple calls**: Kiosk rotates overlays; queue visible in the manager panel.
* **Noise**: Shift lead can **Mute 60s** without dismissing the alert.
* **Shared devices**: If two personal tabs open on one PC, each tab is bound to its employee via PIN; timers independent.

---

If this matches what you want, I’ll package these behaviors into the next build:

* Kiosk overlay + audio/TTS
* Personal tab with 2-minute auto-close
* “Reopen my tasks” flow (PIN required)
* Admin Settings page for the knobs above

Then I’ll ship you a downloadable folder with those features wired in.
